## Introduction

This repository serves as a living document of my journey learning and experimenting with the OpenAI Agents SDK. It aims to provide clear examples, practical implementations, and evolving insights into building powerful agent-based applications. Whether you're new to the SDK or looking to deepen your understanding, you'll find resources here to help guide your mastery.

## Features & Concepts Covered

This repository is continuously updated with new learnings. Key areas explored include:

- Fundamentals of the OpenAI Agent architecture
- Creating and configuring different Agent types
- Defining and using Tools (Functions) with Agents
- Implementing custom instructions and memory patterns
- Handling Agent responses and streaming
- Advanced Agent interactions and workflows
- Best practices for development and deployment

*(As new concepts are learned, they will be added to this list and the relevant examples will be included.)*

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites

- **Python:** Version 3.11 or higher.
- **OpenAI API Key:** Obtain an API key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
- **Git:** Installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Moh-Tayyab/OpenAI-Agents-SDK-Mastery.git
   cd OpenAI-Agents-SDK-Mastery
   ```
2. **(Recommended) Create a virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   uv venv
   # On Windows
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   uv add dependency name
   uv add openai-agents
   ```
4. **Set up your OpenAI API Key:**
   You can set it as an environment variable:
   ```bash
   # On Linux/macOS
   export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
   # On Windows (Command Prompt)
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   # On Windows (PowerShell)
   $env:OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```
   *Alternatively, configure it according to the SDK's documentation.*

## Usage / Examples

Explore the `examples/` directory for hands-on demonstrations of various concepts.

**Example: Running a Basic Agent Script**

```bash
uv run examples/basic_agent_example.py
```

Detailed walkthroughs and explanations for each example can be found within their respective directories or files.

*(Add links or descriptions to specific examples as you create them.)*
